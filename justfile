# Two pyright invocations, not one: pyproject holds exactly one [tool.pyright]
# table, and the package and the tests need separate configs. Per-directory
# typeCheckingMode via executionEnvironments was measured and does not work --
# the total went UP rather than splitting.
typecheck:
    uv run pyright --project pyrightconfig.json
    uv run pyright --project pyrightconfig.tests.json

# THE GATE. Lint, types and the fast suite, in the order that fails cheapest
# first. One command for a human, for a coding agent, and for CI -- so a green
# here means the same thing to all three, and local and CI cannot drift.
#
# NOT pre-commit. `pre-commit install` refuses outright in this repo:
# core.hooksPath is set to .beads/hooks by `bd init`, and globally to
# ~/.githooks. Its own remedy -- `git config --unset-all core.hooksPath` --
# would disable the beads hooks AND every global hook on this machine, a blast
# radius outside this project. Worse, a pre-commit config would have LOOKED
# installed: the beads hook still runs and still exits 0, so the phase would
# have been recorded as landed while doing nothing. That is exactly the
# covered-but-unasserted failure this whole effort exists to remove.
#
# No formatter, deliberately. This codebase has a hand-set style -- aligned
# argv lists, comment-dense blocks -- and running one is a whole-tree diff
# nobody asked for.

# Everything, with coverage. The session-close gate, and the named observer
# that makes deselecting the slow tests honest rather than a quiet loss.
# `-m "slow or not slow"` rather than `-m ""`: it unambiguously overrides the
# deselection in addopts, and empty-marker behaviour is not worth relying on.
#
# --cov-fail-under is not a quality bar, it is a LIVENESS check. This line said
# `--cov=deixis` for as long as the package has been called dsj: coverage
# collected nothing, printed "Module deixis was never imported" and "No data
# was collected" into the middle of a 22-minute run, and exited 0. Every
# coverage number quoted after the rename measured a package that did not
# exist. A floor turns that silence into a failure -- no data reads as 0%.

# The public Urdu-English test recording (#148): 12.5 minutes of one
# code-switching speaker from UrduSpeech (CC-BY-4.0), stitched, with three quiet
# gaps and a ground-truth transcript, into scratch/urdu_cs/. Downloads about
# 64 MB once, then rebuilds from that cache and checks the pinned sha256.
# verify depends on it because the tests that read it FAIL when it is missing
# rather than skip: a fixture test that skips on a fresh clone is green without
# having run.

# Mutation testing over the three pure modules. Coverage proves a line ran;
# this proves the suite would notice if it stopped. Survivors are the
# deliverable -- triage them against docs/mutmut-triage.md, which records why
# each accepted one cannot be killed. Chasing 100% is how this becomes busywork.
#
# mutmut caches by source hash and does NOT notice new TESTS, so a rerun after
# writing a killing test needs the mutants/ tree removed first.
