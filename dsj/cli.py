"""The `dsj` command -- one Typer app, four verbs.

    dsj suno   recording.mov -o transcript.json    # listen
    dsj dekho  recording.mov -t transcript.json    # look
    dsj dikhao recording.mov 431.5 -o frame.jpg    # show me
    dsj likho  transcript.json -o captions.srt     # write

Urdu imperatives, and they are not decoration: the first three name the things
the tool does in the order it does them. Suno gives you what was said, dekho
gives you when the picture changed, dikhao gives you the picture itself. Jaano
-- know -- is what you get from all three, which is why it is the command.
Likho writes what suno heard out for the tools that are not dsj.

This file owns ALL argument parsing for the project. `dsj.suno.main`
and `dsj.dekho.main` are thin shims onto the commands below, so
`python -m dsj.suno` keeps working and there is exactly one definition
of every flag rather than one per entry point.

WHY standalone_mode, AND WHY THE SystemExit CATCH. Typer's other calling
convention, `app(args=..., standalone_mode=False)`, returns the command's value
directly and looks like the obvious fit for `main(argv) -> int`. It is a trap
here for two measured reasons:

  * Typer 0.27 VENDORS its own Click at `typer._click`. Its `UsageError` is not
    the `click.exceptions.UsageError` class, so the obvious `except
    click.exceptions.UsageError` never fires and a bad flag escapes as an
    unhandled NoSuchOption traceback. Catching it properly means importing from
    a private module.
  * standalone_mode=False also skips Click's error rendering, so every usage
    message would have to be reimplemented here.

standalone_mode=True renders errors the way every other Click program does and
raises SystemExit with the right code; catching that gives back the int. Checked
against all six cases that matter: success 0, --help 0, unknown flag 2, no args
2, a caller's own exception PROPAGATES (which the resume tests depend on), and
KeyboardInterrupt becomes 130.
