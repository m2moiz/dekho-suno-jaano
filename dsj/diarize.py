"""senko, behind a boundary that degrades instead of failing.

Diarization is an optional pass over a transcript that is already correct
without it. That asymmetry is the whole design of this module: an hour of ASR
has already been paid for and written to disk by the time anything here runs, so
no way this pass can go wrong is allowed to cost that run. Every foreseeable
failure -- the extra not installed, a model download that cannot reach the net,
a file senko will not open, a diarizer that finds nobody -- arrives at the caller
as one exception type it can catch in one place.

Deliberately narrow, though. A `TypeError` from a bug in this code or in the
merge is NOT converted; it propagates out of `speaker_turns` with its own type.
A missing dependency should be quiet, a bug should be loud, and a bare `except
Exception` cannot tell them apart. The caller, dsj/suno.py, still keeps the
transcript when one does propagate (#186): it logs the type by name and leaves
the run unlabelled, and only `--require-diarize` turns it into a failure.

senko installs 29 packages including scikit-learn, scipy, umap-learn and
coremltools, and only runs on CoreML, so it is an extra rather than a core
dependency. See `INSTALL_HINT` below for the two ways to add it.
