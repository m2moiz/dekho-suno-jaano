"""whisper, for the audio parakeet cannot read.

`parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` is the default engine and stays the default: it runs at
~13x realtime and does not invent words over silence. What it does not have is
Urdu -- its 25 languages are European, and `ur` is not among the model card's
tags. A voice note that mixes Urdu and English comes back as nothing usable.

whisper-large-v3-turbo does read it, at a cost: measured on 116s of Urdu speech
it took 84.7s (~1.4x realtime) against parakeet's ~13x. That is fine for a voice
note and would not be for an hour of lecture, which is why this is a flag and
not a replacement.

ROMAN URDU IS A PROMPT, NOT A SETTING. whisper transcribes Urdu in Urdu script
by default. Seeding the decoder with a Roman Urdu `initial_prompt` makes it emit
Roman instead, and it carries across windows through whisper's own
condition-on-previous-text: over the same 116s, 275 of 277 words came back in
Latin. The two that did not were single words inside otherwise-Roman sentences.

That trick is model-specific, and the difference is not subtle. The full
whisper-large-v3 ignores the prompt completely -- 280 of 280 words in Urdu
script, in 218s rather than 85s. Hence the default here is turbo, and changing
it means re-measuring rather than assuming.
