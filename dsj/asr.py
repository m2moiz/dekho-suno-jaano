"""The one shape every ASR engine in dsj returns.

parakeet and whisper agree on almost nothing. parakeet-mlx hands back an
`AlignedResult` of `AlignedToken`s and is driven chunk by chunk from
dsj/chunking.py so a run can resume; whisper owns its own 30-second window
loop and returns segments carrying words. Naming what they must both produce
keeps that difference inside the two backends instead of spreading it through
suno.py.

The contract is the transcript's own on-disk shape rather than a parallel
object model, because json.dumps is the only consumer and a schema class here
would be flattened straight back into dicts one function later.

Per-token times are the load-bearing half. merge.py labels a sentence by voting
its TOKENS against the diarizer's turns, so an engine that can only give
sentence boundaries can be transcribed but not attributed.
