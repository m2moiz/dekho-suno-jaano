"""Decide who spoke each sentence, by counting token votes against turns.

Diarization emits speaker turns as intervals over the recording; the transcript
has sentences with their own start/end and a start time on every token. The two
segmentations do not line up. parakeet breaks on punctuation and pauses, senko
breaks on voice, and one "sentence" on the reference recording runs 108 seconds
and crosses several turns.

Tokens vote rather than the sentence's span being intersected with the turns,
because a span includes the silences inside it. A speaker who happened to be
talking during a pause in the middle of a sentence can hold more of that span
than the speaker who said the words, and interval overlap would hand them the
sentence. Counting tokens can only ever count words that were actually said.

The two agree on all but 6 of 664 sentences on the reference recording, so this
is a small correctness win, not a large one. It is kept because the failure mode
of interval overlap scales with how interleaved the speech is, and two speakers
with long uninterrupted stretches is the easy case, not the adversarial one.

Nothing here imports senko or loads a model: it is a function of two plain data
structures, which is what makes it testable without a diarizer.
