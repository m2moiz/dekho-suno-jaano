"""transcribe() wiring, exercised against a fake model.

The unit tests in test_chunk_callback.py prove the sample-to-second conversion
is correct. This module proves transcribe() actually hands the model's sample
rate to it, and that the chunk loop, the checkpoint and the heartbeat are wired
to each other -- the half a unit test cannot see.

Only the decode is faked. The chunk boundaries, the offsets and the merge are
the real ones from dsj/chunking.py.
