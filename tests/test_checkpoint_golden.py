"""A checkpoint written before the extraction must resume after it.

The Android port replaces the imported token type with dsj's own
(docs/android-port-design.md). That swap is only safe if it is byte-invisible
to a checkpoint already on disk: a mismatch is not an error, it is a silent
re-transcription of an hour of audio, so no test failure would ever point at
it. This file is the pointing.

`tests/golden/checkpoint-v1.json.ckpt` was written by `write_checkpoint` at
commit eb9ea14, while `AlignedToken` was still parakeet's class -- the real
pre-extraction bytes, committed as a literal file. It must never be
regenerated: a fixture rebuilt by new code only proves the new code agrees
with itself, which is exactly the non-proof this test exists to rule out.

The expected values below are duplicated from the fixture BY HAND, on
purpose. Deriving them from the file at test time would let one bug in the
reader corrupt both sides of the comparison.
