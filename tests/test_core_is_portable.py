"""No core module may import a backend. The fact, checked, not claimed.

The Android port rests on one line: everything outside the engine leaf
modules runs on any machine with Python, numpy and ffmpeg. Nothing else in
the suite can observe that on a Mac, where every backend happens to import --
the failure only exists on the machine that does not have them, which is
exactly the machine that runs no tests. So the line is enforced statically.

AST, not grep: suno.py and friends legitimately MENTION backends in prose --
docstrings argue why parakeet is the default -- and a comment must never fail
this. Only an actual import statement counts, including one inside a function
or under TYPE_CHECKING: function-local backend imports belong in engine
modules, and even a type-only core import would force the backend onto any
environment that typechecks core.
