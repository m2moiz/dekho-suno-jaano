"""The chunk loop, re-driven so it can be resumed.

parakeet-mlx keeps `all_tokens` in a function-local and its chunk_callback
fires before the chunk is decoded (parakeet.py:185-186 precede :194), so there
is no way to seed or observe the accumulation from outside. The loop is
therefore ours; the merge is still theirs.
