"""The heartbeat's whole value is that an outside observer can trust it.

A reader that catches Path.write_text between truncate and write gets an empty
or half-written file, which is worse than no file at all -- it looks like data.

The raw-write_text version of the concurrent-reader test below was run before
this module existed and produced 80 JSONDecodeErrors over 200 writes, so the
race is measured rather than assumed.
