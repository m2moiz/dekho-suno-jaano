"""main()'s summary line.

The `total / elapsed` that used to close this line was unguarded and sat AFTER
the transcript was written, so on an instantaneous run it turned a completed
transcription into a traceback with the output file already on disk. Reaching
elapsed == 0.0 needs a frozen clock -- time.monotonic has nanosecond resolution
on macOS -- which is why it was a P3 and not a field report.

The realtime multiple is gone now, for a second reason: on a resumed run the
whole file's duration over this run's wall clock credits this process with work
a previous one paid for. The tests that pinned it are rewritten below; the ones
that pinned "a completed run still reports itself" keep their full value, and
are the reason the division cannot come back unguarded.
