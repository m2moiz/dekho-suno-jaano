"""The install path the README publishes, executed rather than described.

Every other test in this suite runs against the working tree through `uv run`,
where `.python-version` pins the interpreter to 3.12 and the extras are already
synced. That is not how anyone installs dsj. The README tells a stranger to
run `uv tool install`, which has no project context, reads no
`.python-version`, and resolves its own interpreter from `requires-python`.

Those two paths diverged and nobody noticed, because nothing executed the
second one. `uv tool install` picked Python 3.14; coremltools publishes no
wheel above 3.13 and declares no `requires-python`, so it built from source,
installed cleanly, and failed to load hours later on a 45-minute recording.
The suite was green throughout.

So this gate runs the documented command itself, with the extra, and imports
the thing that broke.

WHY THERE IS NO `skipif` FOR A MISSING senko HERE. tests/test_diarize_gate.py
skips when the diarize extra is absent, which is correct for a gate about
diarization quality and is exactly the shape that hid this bug: a check that
switches itself off in the state it exists to detect. senko being unimportable
is this gate's failure condition, not its skip condition.
