"""Deliberate exceptions for vulture (the orphan gate).

Everything here is read by a framework through reflection, so no reachable
call site exists for vulture to find. Two findings from the same sweep were
real and were deleted instead of listed (an unused tmp_path_factory in
conftest's chunked_audio_path, an unused capsys in test_resume_cli) -- this
file is only for names whose "caller" is pytest, pydantic, or a signature
contract.
