"""An end-to-end diarization gate that cannot silently pass.

Run:
    uv run python scratch/diarize_gate.py --media scratch/meeting.wav
    uv run python scratch/diarize_gate.py --media scratch/meeting.wav --self-test

Same two rules as scratch/resume_gate.py, and for the same reason:

  1. Nothing waits on a clock. Every wait polls an observable with an explicit
     timeout, so the gate cannot become a race that happens to pass on a fast
     machine.
  2. Every leg carries a positive assertion that the thing under test actually
     HAPPENED. "It produced a labelled transcript" is not one of those: a run
     that skipped diarization also finishes, also exits 0, and also writes a
     perfectly good transcript. The phase has to be caught while it is running.

`--self-test` runs leg 1 with --no-diarize. The gate MUST then fail, which is
what makes a pass on the real run mean something.
